Depending on the selected function the window goes to enable. The selection of contacts in the case of forward, the confirmation window in case of delete messages, etc.

## Virtual chats interface

Sometimes, the changes made in the application break the correct navigation in the chat list.
For these cases I added a virtualization of the conversation objects. This allow navigate between the chat list showing in the Window (normally 19). however the order is always arbitrary, and not is the same.
For enable this virtualization only need enable the edit box for search chats with the Shorcut control + f. When this box is opened, the addon capture the objects and put in the virtual list, is possible use with the following commands:

* Control + up arrow; say the previous chat in the virtual list.
* Control + dawm arrow; say the next chat in the virtual list.
* Control + shift + home; say the first chat in the virtual list.
* Control + enter; move the focus to the actual chat in the chat list.

For enter to the chat of a list, first we must navigate with the Shorcuts control + up or dawm arrow, focus with control + enter, and after press only enter.
